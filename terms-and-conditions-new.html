title: Do we agree to the terms & conditions of research
description: Community-owned infrastructure must not only come at a price we can sustain, but with terms that reflect our values, protect our rights, and give us control. We're tracking how these are evolving, what we should ask for, and how to get what we need.

      In December, SPARC assessed an institutional agreement that a Dutch national academic consortia and Elsevier were in the process of negotiating. At the time, we were responding to leaks in the press, which were largely confirmed by the subsequent release of the terms of a framework agreement between the Dutch consortia and the publisher. Last week, the parties announced the official terms of the agreement.
