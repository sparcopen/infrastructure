title: Responsible Metrics and Algorithm
description: "It is important to distinguish upfront between metrics, which refers to what is being measured, and algorithms, which refers to how it is being measured. Metrics should be controlled by academic institutions, and deliberately chosen, rather than relying on those sold by commercial vendors. Algorithms, do not necessarily need to be controlled by each academic institution, but must be carefully understood and monitored."
