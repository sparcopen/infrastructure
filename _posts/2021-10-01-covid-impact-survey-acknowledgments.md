This report would not have been possible without all those who generously volunteered their time to answer our questions. We are grateful for each survey response and would especially like to acknowledge the contributions of those who agreed to be interviewed during a busy and challenging time, including: Janice S. Lewis and Mark M. Sanders (East Carolina University), Kevin Engel (Grinnell College), Elizabeth Mengel (Johns Hopkins University), Rebecca Richardson (Purdue University), and Frances Maloy (Union College). Similarly, this project would not have been possible without the support of the SPARC Steering Committee and financial support of the Open Society Foundations. Finally, we would like to thank early readers for their edits and corrections that have contributed to the accuracy and clarity of this report.
