A number of documents that point to principles for the use of AI have been made publicly available in the recent past.

The [Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University recently released an analysis of Ethical and Rights-Based approaches to using AI](https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2020/principled-ai), based on a survey of 36 prominent documents on AI principles. In addition, a Dutch task force, tasked by a number of local academic and research institutions, has prepared a [draft set of principles](https://www.vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/Guiding%20Principles%20on%20Management%20of%20Research%20Information%20and%20Data_11May.pdf) that are still in a period of open consultation, but that has provided the basis for negotiating the agreement on Read & Publish and “academic intelligence” with Elsevier that was recently signed.

While some of the principles overlap, most do not, and for good reason: the Dutch document is designed to guide relationships between academic and research institutions and third party organizations, while the Berkman Klein document surveys policies that are also designed to affect internal documents such as codes of ethics and data policies on the one hand, and legislative programs of governments at the other end of the spectrum.

Looking at the specific needs of academic institutions, we have identified principles that should affect internal documents (i.e. codes of ethics, data policies), principles that should drive relationships with third parties, and principles that affect both (Exhibit 1). In the following page we will provide a brief description of each principle and some examples of how to translate it into concrete steps (such as provisions in internal codes or contractual terms and conditions).
