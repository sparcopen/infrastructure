In early 2019, SPARC released its Landscape Analysis, an in-depth look at how academic and scholarly publishing are changing, how the leading publishers are responding to these changes, and the implications for the academic community. Later last year, the Landscape Analysis was followed by a Roadmap for Action outlining steps that the academic community might take to manage the issues that surfaced in the earlier document.

What does the landscape look like one year later? This document reviews the events of the past year and provides updates on both the academic publishing market landscape and the suggested actions for the community to consider, particularly in light of the global COVID health and economic crisis. The document also contains an appendix that reviews in more detail the market and financial performance of some key commercial publishers in 2019 and 2020, as well as their response to changes in the respective marketplaces.
