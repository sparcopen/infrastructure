While individual actions are important, collective actions can have an impact at a greater scale. A third category of actions for the community to consider focus on leveraging a strength in numbers approach, and targeting “big picture” actions institutions to regain and maintain control of their data infrastructure. This category includes a broad range of possible structural solutions to foster an open, competitive landscape for data and data analytics that is aligned with the interests of academic institutions and the communities they serve. Open competition and transparency in this crucial space is essential if the academic community wants to ensure better terms and conditions from commercial vendors, more innovation from different sources, and more truly international/global solutions. By working at scale, these actions have the potential to have significant and long-term impacts, and they are intended to be pursued alongside the important campus-level actions that we recommend in the two previous sections.
