In March 2020, as institutions of all types began to shut down in response to the COVID pandemic, colleges and universities quickly modified their operations to be able to continue teaching and research activities. At over 80% of the institutions represented in the survey, some form of hybrid learning model was in place, with courses offered both in-person and online during the 2020-2021 academic year, though often the in-person courses met for very specific reasons—clinical education, labs, art classes. Only 5% reported that classes were “remote only, in real time.”

Most libraries continued to offer services in some way, with over a third reporting that the main campus library was “physically open, with most services operational” and another third reporting being physically open, with limited services. Less than 10% reported being “physically closed” while still offering online services. Over 15% stated some “other” modality, often illustrating the careful thinking involved in providing services to those who needed them. (For example, “Mostly physically closed except one study space to provide those with exceptional needs access to internet, computers, and for staff to provide curbside pickup and digitization services.”) One librarian’s response characterized the unpredictability of the year, describing their status as “It depends, we keep moving in and out of lockdown.”

This rapid shift to an online environment underlined the importance of having materials available online. Over 85% of respondents reported that by Fall 2020 faculty demand for e-resources, whether subscription or OA, was either much greater (45%) or somewhat greater (43%) than in other years. By contrast, librarian perceptions were that faculty demand for “open and free (open access articles, open educational resources, other freely available learning materials)” had not increased as dramatically, with only around 60% reporting increased demand, and the majority of these stating that it was only some-what greater than in other years.

## Budgetary Impact
Nearly 80% of the academic libraries responding to the survey noted some reduction in their budget. Among US-based institutions, 21% noted a reduction of 10% or more. Six of the eleven Canadian respondents, on the other hand, noted no decrease at all, and of those with cuts, none were greater than 19%. All 5 of the respondents from Australian institutions experienced some decrease, ranging from 5% to more than 20% (Figure 1).

Differences among US institutions emerged based on institution type: while a similar proportion of doctoral and non-doctoral institutions noted a budget decrease (over 80% of each), the changes at non-doctoral institutions were more more pronounced: 35% noted a decrease of 10% or more, while only 17% of doctoral institutions had cuts that severe.

When asked how the collections and serials budgets were affected, a smaller proportion of respondents noted some decrease when compared to those who saw cuts in the overall budget. In the US and Australia, around 60% of institutions noted reductions to collections budget and serials budgets, whereas in Canada, less than 20% saw reductions in these. About one third of respondents overall noted that their collections budget remained unchanged and over a third overall noted that the serials budget was unchanged, with Canadian institutions bucking the trend, with a large majority seeing collections and serials budgets unchanged. 

In addition to specific cuts to collections and serials, respondents offered further detail on the type and severity of cuts. Among the common themes that emerged:
* Staff reductions were common, as were hiring freezes
* Even in cases where budgets were not cut, some were unable to make use of those funds, due to “freezes” put in place by administration
* Several libraries were subject to across-the board cuts for the university/college
* Cuts to materials budgets were sometimes held at bay due to cuts in other areas, due to the pandemic – including travel budgets, office supplies, and hiring freezes

Some respondents noted that perhaps more significant than any budget reduction were the re-allocations within the budgets—namely those from print to e-resources. Even those institutions that did not experience budget cuts might experience a resource squeeze, due to increased costs, whether from publisher increases or the amplified need for digital content and platforms.

>*“We have had budget cuts to the collection budget for years, but the combination of chronic budget shortages with the governor’s withholding of funding to cover COVID-related state budget shortfalls have resulted in the largest single year collections budget cut ever.” (71)  
—Public doctoral institution

>*“⅕ of library positions are vacant and under a hiring freeze. Student employee fund-ing was reduced by 10% and our operating budget, including library software and systems, by 30%.” (173)  
—Private doctoral institution

>*“While our budget remains unchanged, our expenses for digital assets went up due to COVID. Our COVID related collections materials costs for Fall semester were $50,000 and we anticipate continued pressure for the Spring 2021 semester. That has meant a reduction in other collections purchases.” (158)  
—Non-doctoral institution

### CONCERN FOR FUTURE REDUCTIONS
Most reporting institutions felt it was unlikely that they would see additional cuts before the end of this academic year, with 32% reporting it was extremely unlikely and the same percentage that it was somewhat unlikely. Only 12% reported feeling it was “extremely likely” that there would be additional cuts. For those who felt additional cuts were either “likely” or “extremely likely,” half predicted that the cuts would be between 5 and 9% and another 6 predicted they would be between 10 and 19%. 

In the US, more doctoral institutions reported being either “somewhat likely” or “extremely likely” to face additional cuts (24%), as compared to non-doctoral institutions (15%). Among those doctoral institutions, private institutions were more likely to feel further cuts would be “extremely unlikely” (43%) compared with public institutions, where only 29% felt this way, and 14% felt rather that it was “extremely likely” they would see them (Figure 2). 

When asked if budget cuts would be permanent, nearly 75% of all respondents felt it was “extremely likely” (30%) or “somewhat likely” (45%). Most US respondents felt that it was “extremely likely” (28%) or “somewhat likely” (50%) that this would be the case.

### IMPACTS WERE NOT THE SAME ACROSS THE BOARD
**Collections and Serials**
While cuts to the collections budget of over 20% were not common among US doctoral institutions, 16% of non-doctoral institutions who participated did report cuts of 20% or more. (That said, 42% of non-doctoral institutions reported “unchanged” budgets, compared with 27% of reporting doctoral institutions.) Similarly, when it comes to the serials budget, non-doctoral institutions appear to have had the most extreme cuts (by percentage reduction) of existing budget levels; 11% reported losing over 20% of their serials budget; while only 4% of doctoral institutions reported cuts this severe. 

The landscape in Canada for academic libraries is significantly different from that in the United States. The eleven Canadian institutions that reported were much less likely to have experienced severe budget cuts than their American counterparts; five of the respondents noted no change at all and one noted an increase! 64% of Canadian respondents noted that the collections budget was unchanged and 18% of Canadian respondents noted an increase to the collections budget.) Four of the 8 Canadian insti-tutions to respond to this question felt the current cuts were not likely to be permanent) and most respondents (73%) felt further cuts would be “extremely unlikely.”

**Strategies for Dealing with Budget Cuts**
As a result of COVID-related budget pressure, librarians, especially those in the US, where budgets were most negatively affected, had to make many adjustments with very little time and a great deal of uncertainty. As one senior administrator noted, “information from the university came quickly, and was oftentimes rapidly changing.” A Director of Academic Library Services at a public university emphasized the challenges inherent in rapid decision-making: “a real frustration for us was a really short turnaround from the time that funds (were) available to the deadline to submitting a request to get them… We could have been more strategic, but deadlines [and] administration made it hard to assess the options, get the pricing [and] negotiate the prices.” 

>*“We could have been more strategic, but deadlines [and] administration made it hard to assess the options, get the pricing 
[and] negotiate the prices.”

Survey participants were asked, “as a result of COVID-related budget pressure, how likely” they were to undertake certain actions. Many reported that they had already begun pursuing certain strategies. Over 70% of respondents noted that they had already chosen to “seek discounts from publishers” at the time of the survey and an additional 26% said they were likely to do so in the future as a result of COVID-related budget pressures. Over a quarter (27%) had already unbundled a Big Deal, with an additional 44% likely to do so in the future. A similar number of institutions reported having made, or being likely to make, significant cuts to large journal packages. Unfortunately, nearly a fifth of institutions (19%) had already cut staff positions as a result of the pandemic, and another 19% were at least “somewhat likely” to do so in the future (Figure 3). 

Unsurprisingly, libraries that experienced budget cuts of 10% or more were more likely to have already implemented one of the strategies described above than those which reported lesser cuts. Beyond those, a similar proportion of institutions, regardless of the size of their budget cut, indicated they were likely to employ additional strategies in the future. For example, those with both large and small cuts were equally likely to consider unbundling a big deal or making significant cuts to a large journal package. 

Survey respondents were asked how their institution’s strategies had changed as a result of COVID-related issues. [Q15] In Canada, where budgets were generally less affected, respondents largely increased attention and resources to almost all areas. This was not the case among US institutions, where library respondents demonstrated stronger support for some activities than for others. While 78% of US respondents reported increased attention or resources for licensed digital materials and 61% increased support for internal digitization efforts, only 24% noted increased support for investments in open infrastructure projects and 17% noted increased support for library publishing (Table 1).

Understanding which actions have had the greatest impact may be easier to do with some distance, but respondents shared their thoughts about the “one action your library has taken that has had the greatest impact.” [Q16] The responses suggested just how quickly libraries have had to pivot to provision of content for faculty and students, and how creatively they have had to consider working within the restricted budgets they have. 

Respondents cited many different ways to access licensed digital content as being most impactful, whether provisioning more material in digital formats, paying less for content they already have access to, or finding new ways to access materials, through: 
* Supporting the use and creation of OER
* Increased licensing of digital materials, including for streaming video
* Internal digitization efforts “because they directly impact faculty’s ability to teach successfully”
* Seeking perpetual access and/or unlimited usage
* Renegotiating to obtain either publisher discounts/lower increases
* Expanding use of controlled digital lending, including use of HathiTrust’s emergency temporary access service
* Increasing contributions to campus Open Access publishing funds

While these actions were cited as impactful, some respondents pointed out that they were not necessarily “new.” As one Library Director at a public doctoral-granting institution noted, “Actually, our strategy has not changed due to COVID. We are using this situ-ation as a way to advocate for more open information and the move to more OER. We have been pushing on these initiatives for years so we are taking advantage of people’s openness to digital and online courses... to adapt to a new online environment.” 

In some cases, the enthusiasm for creating and promoting the use of Open Educational Resources was somewhat tempered by the constraints of the pandemic. A senior administrator at a private masters-degree granting institution highlighted the challenge of implementing open efforts in a year with a long list of other challenges at hand: “[Our] publishing output has decreased this year as our faculty struggle to pivot to online teach-ing, therefore, advocating for open access took a back seat. Our Special Collections librarian has upped her digitization efforts to support online teaching.” 

**Impact of Budget Cuts on the Big Deal & Open Initiatives**
Librarians took a wide range of approaches to dealing with budget cuts, from renegotiating contracts, to cancelling subscriptions, to shifting funds to internal digitization work. Of those libraries who experienced “small” budget reductions (defined here as 9% or less), 45% were likely to seek to unbundle a Big Deal—and a quarter of respondents had already chosen to do so (Figure 4). Those whose institutions experienced major budget cuts (defined here as over 9%), were even more supportive of this option: 43% were likely to explore unbundling a Big Deal, and another 43% reported already having done so.

For some librarians, the fiscal urgency ushered in by COVID-related budget cuts permitted them to take actions that had already long been in the works. In one case, “this gave us the extra justification we needed” to initiate a re-negotiation with Elsevier. One public research university used the pandemic as an opportunity to revisit their Elsevier contract a year early, looking to either renegotiate the cost of the existing bundle or unbundle altogether. A private university library chose to re-negotiate with all major vendors with whom they had an annual spend of $150K or more.

A liberal arts college undertook a renegotiation with Elsevier, which they felt was successful because they were able to make clear that “we were ready to walk.”

>**We were ready to walk.** *—Liberal Arts college on why they were successful in renegotiation of their Big Deal. 

In a similar vein, while unbundling Big Deals or pulling back on other publisher packages was of interest to many and possible for some institutions, several respondents noted that —ironically—the reasons for needing to unbundle were also acting to keep them in place, not least of which was the inability, due to lack of staff capacity, to take on the work of preparing for an unbundling project or to manage the potential additional ILL workload it could create. “We did look, using Unsub, to see if we should be breaking things up,” noted one. “But we had lost positions in the access services area—ILL and circ —and if we cut these things we needed to have enough people in the ILL to do the work to get those materials. It seemed like a bad time to increase the work, with fewer people there.”

For some institutions, COVID may have highlighted the need for more digital content; however, the ability to take transformative action, in the form of new content creation or new models was, for some, simply not practical in the short term.

At some institutions, the complexity and importance of Big Deals may have served to insulate them from these cuts. More than once, a librarian described the process of look-ing for what to cull from the collection, in search of budgetary savings: The easiest items to cancel were collections (rather than reducing staff); and within collections, one-time purchases, including monographs and independent journal titles. The challenge of unraveling the Big Deal was seen by some as expensive and time consuming, and some librarians noted that it was the wrong time to undertake a major shift that would require additional staff time to locate titles for faculty as needed, since there were fewer staff on hand to help.

**Current and Anticipated Future Support for Open Initiatives** 
The changes brought on by the COVID pandemic made clear how important access to online content and workspaces are for faculty and students, among others. Suddenly, the only materials available to students were those available digitally; the only work-spaces safe for teachers and classes were online spaces such as Zoom meeting rooms. With the entire workforce working from home, the strength and robustness of the digital content and infrastructure were put to the test.

College and university campuses have long been making the “transition” from print to digital collections. In recent years, not only investing in e-content and databases, but in a growing movement to invest in the infrastructure, platforms used to create, store and share content. With the higher education community now having been forced to move entirely online due to the pandemic restrictions, SPARC wondered if this bolstered the case for supporting academy-led open access initiatives. 

Survey respondents were asked to report if and how they support different “open” initia-tives, and to consider how these might change in the future. The four types included:
* **Open Infrastructure:** Platforms, tools, and other software to support publication of open communication of research results, such as PKP, Fedora, or OpenCitations.
* **Open Content Initiatives:** creating or providing scholarly materials for free to those who use them, such as Open Libraries of Humanities or Knowledge Unlatched.
* **Supporting Organizations:** offering guidance, training, or advocacy to support the open research ecosystem (e.g. LPC, SPARC, DOAJ)
* **Open Access Agreements** with subscription publishers, such as publish & read agreements

Even before the pandemic, many libraries had already begun to support some of these efforts financially. Ninety-two percent (92%) of respondents reported offering financial support to supporting organizations; 70% for Open Content initiatives, 59% for open infrastructure, and 58% for open access agreements with publishers (Table 2). Nearly a third of respondents indicated that they donate developer time or other in-kind contri-butions to open infrastructure platforms, and several reported that “we are building our own” open infrastructure (19%) or open content initiative (15%).

Faced with the COVID-related budget cuts, would libraries choose to maintain these levels of support? Perhaps decrease them, due to lack of funds? Or increase them, as a way to protect against future rising costs from commercial alternatives? 

Across the board, respondents saw their investments in open initiatives as likely to stay the same or grow in the year to come (Table 3). While over 50% of respondents noted that their levels of support for open infrastructure platforms would stay the same, 31% noted that they were likely to increase somewhat and another 4% noted they would increase significantly. Similar patterns noted for open content initiatives and supporting organizations. For Open access agreements with subscription publishers, a majority of respondents noted that their investments would increase somewhat (54%) or signif-icantly (9%). Notably, none of the eleven Canadian respondents expected to decrease their investments in these areas.

In other words, in the face of large budget cuts and a good deal of uncertainty concern-ing future potential risks, the vast majority of libraries maintained or even expanded their support for open initiatives (Figure 5). This is a trend that seems likely to continue. When asked to consider how investments might change “beyond next year,” 62% of all respond-ents (and 91% of reporting Canadian institutions) reported that “we will allocate more resources than we did this year.” [Q19]

In addition to investments in open initiatives, respondents also shared a wide range of strategies used, including building support with faculty and partners, investment in local and consortial transformative agreements, and increased outreach to faculty to “garner support for library actions.” 

One highlighted the importance of consortial investments and another underlined their commitment to maintaining existing investments, even in difficult financial times. (“We will continue our historic investments as well (which is saying a lot when the budget is shrinking).” Several noted that they were still not sure, and planned to “keep evaluating and determining what works best for our organization.”

Respondents were asked to consider “what effect will the changes being put in place today have on the library landscape in the next 5 years?” Most felt that while the changes put in place may have been in response to very specific conditions, they were likely to last beyond the pandemic. Among those changes respondents felt were most likely to last were: increased demand for online resources (97%) and freely available online resources (91%) from faculty and students and a push for libraries to re-negotiate contracts with vendors to reduce costs (84%) in light of budgetary constraints (Table 4).

There were, however, a few choices that did not elicit as strong a consensus. While 53% of respondents felt library publishing investments would continue beyond the pandemic, 38% felt it would “not happen at all.” Similarly, 56% felt that "we will observe a significant reallocation of funds from paid subscription products to investment in open infrastructure,” while 30% disagreed. 

Among US institutions, there were some notable differences between doctoral and non-doctoral institutions. While neither felt investments in library publishing or open infrastructure would be increased post pandemic, a greater proportion of non-doctoral institutions were more pessimistic than their doctortal counterparts. Only 40% of US non-doctoral institutions felt that “the library will invest significantly more than today in library publishing,” while 57% of doctoral institutions felt the same. 

Similarly, there was a large gap between the proportion of US doctoral and non-doc-toral institutions that felt that “a significant re-allocation of funds for paid subscription products to invest in open access publishing agreements” would be seen beyond the pandemic. While 71% of doctoral institutions saw this strategy persisting, while only 55% of non-doctoral institutions felt the same way, with a full 25% of those institutions feeling it would not happen at all (in contrast to 16% of doctoral institutions that felt the same way).

Even if most respondents felt certain changes were likely to take place—somewhere—whether or not they thought it was likely to happen at their own institutions was a different story. In thinking about the longer-range impacts of these COVID-related changes, respondents were asked to consider the same list of changes, but this time to indicate whether they wanted to see the change take place at their institution; whether they thought it would take place at their institution; and whether they thought it would take place at many other institutions. 

While many felt library budgets for materials will be “significantly lower than in the past” at many other US institutions (88%); virtually nobody wanted to see it happen, but nonetheless almost half felt it was likely to happen at their own intuition (Table 5).

Among all US institutions reporting, 65% felt “a significant reallocation of funds from paid subscription products to investment in open infrastructure” was likely to occur at many institutions and 58% described it as something they’d want to see at their own institution, though only 40% felt it was likely to happen at their own institution (Table 5). Similarly, 63% wanted to see the library “invest significantly more than today in library publishing,” but only 36% thought it was likely to happen at their institution (while 59% felt it was likely to happen elsewhere).

**Pressing Concerns**
While the focus of this SPARC survey was specifically to assess the impact of COVID-related budgetary constraints on academic libraries, respondents made clear that the impact went far beyond questions concerning collections, touching all parts of their operations. 

Respondents were asked to rank their “most pressing concerns—beyond the health and safety of staff and library users—about the impact of COVID on your library.” Loss of staff and cuts to licensed content were ranked first and second, far ahead of the other options offered, including inability to circulate print, reductions in support for open initiatives and loss of staff due to furloughs. But there were some interesting differences among respondents from different types of institutions.

While libraries at US doctoral institutions were more likely to be concerned about their inability to circulate print collections, non-doctoral institutions and Canadian institutions ranked “other” much higher (third and first place respectively). Among the things they described as concerns were the impact of community-wide decreases on the purchas-ing power of their consortium; re-prioritizing the collections budget to meet demand for pedagogical tools and content, including streaming video and audio resources; and keeping pace with quickly changing teaching practices.

In addition, respondents were asked to offer further detail outlining their concerns. These responses offer a more nuanced story.

Staffing issues related not just to present personnel levels, but to the impact of policies put in place during the pandemic on current and future colleagues were of concern. At several institutions, even when no one was furloughed or fired, positions were often frozen, so no new hires were possible and open positions remained open. Some noted that the COVID-era atmosphere has been terrible for morale, which is likely to have longer-range impacts as well. “We’re losing some of our dynamic younger people” as those close to retirement “have too much invested in the community to leave on the spur of the moment.” (95) For those who remain, respondents noted concerns of low morale due to “persistent cuts to salary, benefits and travel budgets” (159) and more generally a “weakened library culture” due to “Loss of face-to-face contact with other library employees and hallway-type interactions. Not getting to know new employees as well.” (176) (178)

For those facing cuts to collections, print and special collections were called out as at risk. (205)

Some noted the need to re-prioritize the collections budget “to fulfill demand for streaming video/audio resources. We have cut our spending on serials to focus more on streaming content. Monograph budgets are flat.” (225)

Even those institutions not facing direct or severe cuts themselves noted a range of ways in which they were also feeling the impact of COVID-related cutbacks in their organizations and throughout the community. In some cases, funding was not cut, but “frozen,” stalling long-planned capital projects or key hires. As one noted, “I have the money but am not allowed to spend it. I have had plans for moving the library forward in the area of digital scholarship and open access through new hires (positions are frozen) and a library renovation to create a digital scholarship center.” (65)

Where libraries are part of consortia, the impacts are felt for all. “If our consortium members' budgets decrease, it has an impact on how much new material (archival data-bases, for instance) we can purchase. In other words, there is more power in working with a group than having to purchase direct, alone—so even if our budget isn't impacted directly, our pricing will reflect an increase if we have to buy on our own, and thus our budget will be squeezed more than anticipated/expected in prior years.” (39)

One librarian noted the difficult position the library can be placed in, when seen as the key provider of content, without having the ability to deliver. The respondent noted a “loss of campus support because we're unable to provide the resources expected in the online environment. The library/librarians are being held accountable for situations created by faculty authors & publishers with restrictive copyright licensing. This [is] significantly true for eBook availability.” (91)

Beyond library collections, many respondents underlined the significance of the services and physical spaces of the library, noting that while being able to offer services virtually is a sign of the strength of the institution (“the Libraires is being seen as the answer to equitable access to technology” (60), the de-emphasizing of the physical space could pose a long-term risk. 

In a sense, the need to rapidly convert the library into a mostly virtual, contact-free space—and libraries’ success in doing this so quickly and effectively—may now somewhat undermine future perceptions of the value of those spaces. 
* “What will happen to library spaces now that we have proven that we can do 80-90%of our jobs remotely and that students and faculty have gotten used to teaching and learning online,” asked one. (129)
* “We are open but with adjustments, including limiting hours and building capacity as well as prioritizing online resources and services. This is serving our students’ needs from an information perspective, but I worry about the social and communal perspective. Our library, like many others, was a space for collaboration and explo-ration. We host art exhibits, poetry readings, scholarly debates, and other events. All of that has changed to one degree or another. My worry is how students are coping with this loss and how we restore the image of the library as a place for ingenuity and collaboration once we have a few years of changed atmosphere.” (150)
* “The library as space is pretty important on our campus. If our space use decreases over the long term, I worry about what that means for the library generally.” (247)
