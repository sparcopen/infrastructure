In December, [SPARC assessed an institutional agreement that a Dutch national academic consortia and Elsevier were in the process of negotiating](https://sparcopen.org/news/2019/leaked-dutch-contract-with-elsevier-raises-significant-alarm-bells/). At the time, we were responding to leaks in the press, which were largely confirmed by the subsequent release of the terms of a framework agreement between the Dutch consortia and the publisher. Last week, the parties announced the official terms of the agreement.

As a quick recap, we originally noted five concerns:

* Danger of linking publishing and data contracts into a “Bigger Deal”
* A deal structure inhibiting competition in data analytics services
* The implications of the resulting reduced competition on customer leverage
* The creation of a monopoly (or quasi-monopoly) on data analytics resulting in the
loss of diversity in academic assessment
* The risks that the deal’s structure, if replicated, would pose to the overall health of
the scholarly publishing ecosystem

While some new details have emerged since SPARC released our initial analysis, none of them materially change our conclusions. The [newly released FAQ page](https://vsnu.nl/files/documenten/Nieuwsberichten/FAQS%20around%20the%20Elsevier%20VSNU%2 0agreement%20FINAL.pdf) on the deal 2 only adds to our concerns. The language of the FAQ is couched in ways that appear reassuring (“There is no exclusive relationship and third parties can also co-develop services and tools”), but the reality is that the academic institutions who signed the deal may have little incentive to use multiple vendors providing similar services. Having more than one tool to perform any evaluation only adds costs and complexity and is likely to be economically unsustainable.

The only area of concern articulated in our original analysis where we still have to suspend judgement is the potential impact of the deal on the economics of scholarly publishing, because the full financial terms of the agreement have not been made available. We cannot confirm if the Dutch consortia really received a zero increase on the aggregate “Read and Publish” costs in exchange for introducing Elsevier’s data analytics products (as the original leak suggested). In the absence of confirmation, we cannot determine for certain whether the deal leads to a path that may hurt smaller publishers, affecting the overall health of scholarly publishing – but the absence of specifics is, in itself, one of the many problems posed by the actual deal.

Sarah de Rijcke, the Scientific Director of The Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University, an institution dedicated to studying scientific research and its connections to technology, innovation, and society, raised a number of troubling questions in a recent blog post . Professor de Rijcke notes:

* The agreement allows Elsevier to build the modules that would represent the building blocks of a national Dutch Open Knowledge Base and potentially undermines plans for a community-owned initiative in this area. Professor de Rijcke notes that the current deal structure provides Elsevier what amounts to “an insurmountable competitive advantage in terms of access to research intelligence.”

* The agreement raises the question whether Elsevier is requested to deposit proper metadata to Crossref, and whether this metadata (including citations) will be fully open.

* The money spent in acquiring Elsevier tools now becomes unavailable to support competing services; a general tender to all interested third parties would have been a better approach.

Professor de Rijcke concludes “I am not persuaded by the contract, and still find disconcerting that this deal may effectively transfer crucial means to influence Dutch science policy to a monopolistic private enterprise.”

In addition to Professor de Rijcke’s concerns, there are three additional elements of the agreement to take note of.

1. **Principles**. In early 2020, the participating consortia charged a Task Force with establishing terms and conditions under which public research metadata could be used by public and private organizations, and with outlining the development of an open knowledge infrastructure in cooperation with private vendors. As part of this work, the Task Force formulated guiding principles to define the relationships between academic institutions and third-party organizations in the release and use of metadata.
